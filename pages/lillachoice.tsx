            i'm always taking time to play the games I like to finish the
            lillachoice list and I even had to buy{' '}
            <span className="font-bold">Unravel 2</span>, the sequel of my
            personal Inside. Ib though was a game I always wanted to check out
            as a self-professed hipsters of games and I felt I required the push
            of the lillachoice. It was as rough and indie and hipster as
            expected but it was also quite inventive and smart so kudos for
            pezzo. <span className="font-bold pr-2">Inscryption</span>
            was maybe a too good of a suggestion as it was very high in my list
            so it will probably be the last game I play in the upside down world
            of the Lillachoice. I will also be grateful to Matteo for the{' '}
            <span className="font-bold">Caves of Qud</span> patch notes which I
            miss dearly. Some watch a gameplay video instead of playing the
            game, I just read patch notes. (if it's not long enough) I enjoyed
            my brother <span className="font-bold">book</span>, he is always the
            safest lillachoicer ever since{' '}
            <span className="font-bold">Homeless Tycoon</span> which I've played
            in Scotland. The real Lillachoice experience though is trying to
            figure out why Carlo suggested you a certain game. I'm still
            investigating about why{' '}
            <span className="font-bold">Legion TD2</span> but I've heard it's
            better then Legion TD1 so that's one thing.

            I caught up with some of the old lillachoices that I had this year!
            <span className="font-bold">Eliza</span> was a nice novel game that
            forced me to read but was worth the effort! Unfortunately I can’t
            say the same for <span className="font-bold">Finding Paradise</span>
            since I didn’t enjoy it as much, but it was a nice suggestion! I
            appreciate <span className="font-bold">Carlo and Miso</span> for
            giving me something that I was able to complete without too much
            effort, but what I loved the most of all was{' '}
